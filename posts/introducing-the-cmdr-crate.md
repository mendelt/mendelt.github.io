# Introducing the Cmdr crate

Cmdr is a crate I started at the end of last year. I had been trying to learn Rust for quite some time but I decided I needed a serious project to get started. I had been working on a project based on
the Python Cmd package at work to make an interactive shell-like command line app. Since there was nothing like this for Rust I decided to make it myself.

In Python Cmd you create an interactive shell by creating objects that inherit from the Cmd base class and that implement methods starting with do and help. These methods are then used by the library
to implement commands that the user can call by typing them. Cmd then also implements a comprehensive help function and tab-autocompletion with lots of extension points for the user.
