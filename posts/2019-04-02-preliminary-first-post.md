# Preliminary first post on this blog

This is the first post on this weblog. I'll be writing here about my projects, Rust, electronics and collected stuff. I'll be trying my best to bore you off this site as fast as possible, just to save you time.
While I'm working on this blog you might want to check out [Cmdr](https://github.com/mendelt/cmdr), which is a cool project I've been working on in Rust.
