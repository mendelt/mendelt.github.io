      <h2>Mendelt Siebenga - About</h2>
<p>Welcome to this unmaintained mess I call my website. I'm Mendelt Siebenga, a software engineer living near Rotterdam in the Netherlands. During the day I program robots in Python, I play with electronics, synthesizers and Rust the rest of the time.</p>
<p>My [writings] can be found on my [blog], the main page of this site.</p>
<p>And I also have links to some of my [projects], maybe I'll finish one of them one of these days.</p>
<p>no dancing hamsters though...</p>
