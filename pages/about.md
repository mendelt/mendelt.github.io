## Mendelt Siebenga - About

Welcome to this unmaintained mess I call my website. I'm Mendelt Siebenga, a software engineer living near Rotterdam in the Netherlands. During the day I program robots in Python, I play with electronics, synthesizers and Rust the rest of the time.

My [writings] can be found on my [blog], the main page of this site.

And I also have links to some of my [projects], maybe I'll finish one of them one of these days.

no dancing hamsters though...
